Project Title: Fake News Detection Using Logistic Regression

Description:
The "Fake News Detection Using Logistic Regression" project aims to develop an effective model for identifying and classifying news articles as real or fake. With the rapid spread of misinformation online, detecting fake news has become increasingly important for maintaining the integrity of information and ensuring informed decision-making.

Objectives:
Data Collection: The project involves gathering a comprehensive dataset of news articles, both real and fake, from reliable sources and fact-checking websites.
Feature Extraction: Key features will be extracted from the text data, such as word frequency, sentiment analysis, and other linguistic properties, to enhance the model's predictive capability.
Model Development: Utilizing logistic regression, a statistical method suitable for binary classification tasks, the project will train the model on the extracted features to accurately predict the authenticity of news articles.
Evaluation: The modelâ€™s performance will be assessed using various metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, to ensure reliability and effectiveness in real-world applications.

Technologies Used:
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: The project will leverage libraries such as Pandas for data manipulation, Scikit-learn for implementing logistic regression, and NLTK or SpaCy for natural language processing tasks.

Expected Outcomes: The outcome of this project will be a robust model capable of analyzing news articles and providing real-time predictions regarding their authenticity. This model can serve as a tool for journalists, researchers, and the general public to identify credible news sources and combat misinformation.

By addressing the critical issue of fake news, this project not only contributes to the field of data science but also promotes responsible information consumption in society. Through rigorous analysis and model training, the project aims to enhance public awareness and empower users to make informed decisions based on accurate information.
